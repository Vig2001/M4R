# Modelling Heterogeneity in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

Overall Grade: 74.6%

Introduction: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a devestating disease that primarily affects young boys. Unfortunately, most of the young boys die by the age of 16. There are treatments currently being developed to alleviate the symptoms and elongate the lifespan of many patients. However, it is difficult to approve such treatments, because the NSAA (one of the primary scoring systems being used) fails to capture the inter-patient heterogeneity rendering a lot of clinical trials uninformative and not statistically powerful. 

AIM: Propose a novel measurement that can better explain the heterogeneity in the latent trait (patient disease severity / motor function).

What has been done:
- Fitted a GLS model to 131 placbeo group patients to understand the mean trajectory (useful for simulating trials)
- Simulated clinical trials using the NSAA framework to specify the requirements for a statistically powerful trial
- Critically analysed the NSAA and proposed a novel measurement using PCA

What is being done:
- Treating each individual items as ordinal values rather than numerical and then conducting PCA
- Research into IRT models (Graded Response Model)
- Another simulation study to determine which of the scoring frameworks result in a more powerful test
